# ft_ls
My own implementation of the unix ls command with the flags [Rlart]

Type "make" into the terminal to compile the program and generate an excutable called ft_ls. To run you use ./ft_ls which is the same as "ls -1"
then run using flags, ./ft_ls -l and other's. I also catered for multiple flags ./ft_ls -alrtR, Though my recursion is not as fast the system but it keeps up
when I use "time ./ft_ls -R /".

Enjoy...

How you run it is easy you just clone and run make.
